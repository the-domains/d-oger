  Castle Chambord began construction by King Francios I of France after
  returning from Milan where he was inspired by the Italian renaissance.
  Originally intended as a hunting lodge, he only spent 72 days at the lodge and
  died before completion. His son, Henry II is responsible for the completion.
  The famous double spiral staircase is attributed to the design of Leonardo da
  Vinci, which consists of 2 concentric spiral stairs that wind independently
  around a hollow column.
