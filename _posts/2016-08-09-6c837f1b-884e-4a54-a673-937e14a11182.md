Hautefort Castle was a medieval fortress transformed into a stately home during the 17th century. A French formal garden and English style park was added during the 19th century. The Baroness restored the castle to take up residence in the 1960's only to have all her hard work destroyed in a fire in 1968\. She was able to restore the castle a second time with help from the village to what it is today.
